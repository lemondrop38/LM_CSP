# LM 6th Expressions Notes

# 1. What is an algorithm?
    # An algorithm is a set of instructions to accomplish a task. An algorithm always does the same steps.
name = input("What is your name?")
print("Hello", name)

# Algorithum for area
length = 5
width = 20
area  = length * width
print(length, "*", width, "=", area)

# 2. List steps in an algorithm
    # Step1 -Determine peices of information needed. Step2 -Process information. Step3 -Provide an output.

# Algorithum for average
    #Step1
age_one = 14
age_two = 14
age_three = 14
age_four = 15
    #Step2
total= age_one + age_two + age_three+ age_four
average = total/4
    #Step3
print("the average age between:", age_one, "-", age_two, "-", age_three,"-", age_four, "=", average)
    
# 3. List ALL of the different mathematical operators (Give me the symbol and tell me what it does)
    #

# 4. List ALL of the different assignment operators (Give me the symbols and what it does)
    #

# 5. Why are expressions so important in programming?
    #

# 6. What is an expression?

#Math Equations!
num_one = 12

print("addition:", num_one + num_two)
print("subtraction:", num_one - num_two)
print("multiplication:", num_one * num_two)
print("division:", num_one / num_two)
print("exponents:", num_one ** num_two)
print("integer division", num_one // num_two)
print("modulo (remainder):", num_one % num_two)

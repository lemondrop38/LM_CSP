# LM 6th Expressions Notes

# 1. What is an algorithm?
    # An algorithm is a set of instructions to accomplish a task. An algorithm always does the same steps.
name = input("What is your name?")
print("Hello", name)

# Algorithum for area
length = 5
width = 20
area  = length * width
print(length, "*", width, "=", area)

# 2. List steps in an algorithm
    # Step1 -Determine peices of information needed. Step2 -Process information. Step3 -Provide an output.

# Algorithum for average
    #Step1
age_one = 14
age_two = 14
age_three = 14
age_four = 15
    #Step2
total= age_one + age_two + age_three+ age_four
average = total/4
    #Step3
print("the average age between:", age_one, "-", age_two, "-", age_three,"-", age_four, "=", average)
    
# 3. List ALL of the different mathematical operators (Give me the symbol and tell me what it does)
    #Math Equations!
num_one = 57
num_two = 5

print("addition:", num_one + num_two)
print("subtraction:", num_one - num_two)
print("multiplication:", num_one * num_two)
print("division:", num_one / num_two)
print("exponents:", num_one ** num_two)
print("integer division", num_one // num_two)
print("modulo (remainder):", num_one % num_two)

# Float is a decimal
# Integer is a whole number

# 4. List ALL of the different assignment operators (Give me the symbols and what it does)
    #Assingment operators. Use the key word "round" when you want things to be rouded
num_one = float(input("Give me a number:\n"))
num_two = int(input("Give me a numer:\n"))

num_one += num_two
print("addition(+):", round(num_one, 0)) #1. What needs rounded 2. How many decimals
num_one -= num_two
print("subtraction(-):", num_one)
num_one *= num_two
print("multiplication(*):", num_one)
num_one /+ num_two
print("division(/):", round(11/3, 2))
num_one **= num_two
print("exponents(**):", num_one)
num_one //= num_two
print("integer division(//):", num_one)
num_one %= num_two
print("modulo (remainder)(%):", num_one)
print("(3*5**2/15)-(5-2**2)=",(3*5**2/15)-(5-2**2))



# 5. Why are expressions so important in programming?
    # Because once you do things once you never have to do it agian. It's a long term way to make things easier.
